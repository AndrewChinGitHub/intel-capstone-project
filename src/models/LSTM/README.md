# LSTM Model
The Long-short term memory model, otherwise known as the LSTM, is a recurrent neural network that is well suited for time-series forecasting and sequence prediction problems. 
The LSTM is structured on memory blocks that are connected through layers. It uses backpropagation of layers and time-step lookback values for model training.

## Multivariate LSTM
1. Transform irregular time-series data to regular time-steps
2. Encode data for supervised learning problem
3. Predict next app sequence at regular time-intervals 
4. Combine to predict app usage times and sequences over testing period
